    <h3>System for the detection of bottle
 misalignments for a bottle spraying
 system of a glass manufacturer</h3>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Author:</strong> João Ferreira</p>

  <p><strong>Summary:</strong>The topic of this dissertation concerns a challenge faced by the equipment man
ufacturer for the glass industry, Vidromecânica. The growing demand for efficiency
 and innovation has driven the manufacturing industry to adopt advanced automation
 solutions. In today's competitive environment, where consumer expectations are in
creasingly high, companies are constantly seeking ways to optimize their processes and
 improve the quality of their products.
 The field of computer vision emerges as a crucial tool in this new era of industry,
 where automated processes are becoming increasingly predominant, driving us toward
 Industry 4.0.
 This project aims to automate a spraying process that requires an integrated control
 system. During this process, a substance is applied to the external surface of the bottles
 to give them their final coating. These bottles are arranged in parallel lines, with
 the sprayer moving through the empty spaces between these lines, spraying only the
 outside. At this stage, a control system is essential to check if the bottles are correctly
 positioned. Otherwise, the sprayer must be stopped before applying the substance,
 thus avoiding potential health issues for the end consumers.
 Moreover, automating the spraying process promises a range of significant benefits.
 Among these, a substantial increase in operational efficiency is expected, resulting in
 higher productivity and cost reduction. The precision and consistency provided by the
 computer vision system will also contribute to improving the final product's quality,
 ensuring a uniform finish on all bottles. Finally, by minimizing the waste of the sprayed
 substance, the system will help optimize resources and the environmental sustainability
 of the manufacturing process.
 This work employs a computer vision system capable of capturing images using
 an industrial camera with an Ethernet interface and detecting bottles frame by frame
 through methods to be studied, such as the Hough transform, adapted for circle detec
tion. Subsequently, possible misalignments are detected to prevent the substance from
 being sprayed inside the bottles.
 This dissertation was carried out as part of the VidroTec 4.0 project- Bottle Spray
ing Control System, funded by the company Vidromecânica.</p>

    <h3>Single-Camera Mirror-Assisted Detection of Quality Marks for Automotive Windshield Control</h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Ferreira, João Ferreira, Mohammad Zarei, Paulo Menezes</p>
    <p><strong>Published in::</strong> RTSI 2025 -  9º International Forum IEEE Research and Technologies for Society and Industry</p>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In today's industry, efficient and precise vision
 systems that support robotic operations are essential to ensure
 continuous and smooth production, and the automotive industry
 is no exception. In this paper, we present a creative approach
 for detecting and inspecting quality features on windshields
 by coupling a single-camera with a programmable moving
 mirror system. Our method addresses the challenges posed by
 limited space and constraints for multi-camera setups that are
 often overlooked in production environments. The experimental
 apparatus of this system uses a camera with a 50mm focal
 length lens that captures different areas of the windshields at
 multiple positions via a precisely controlled mirror. We introduce
 a calibration technique that uses homography-based distortion
 correction to account for perspective changes caused by different
 mirror positions. In addition, the algorithm includes an OCR
 stage with an image filtering bank optimized for glass surfaces
 that enables accurate code recognition under different windshield
 types and curvatures. The experimental results show that the
 system is capable of reliably recognizing and verifying quality
 features. Compared to other scanning systems with multiple
 cameras or robots, our approach offers significant advantages
 in terms of cost efficiency, space savings and possible adaptation
 to different configurations of production lines.</p>
